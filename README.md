This repo is my solution to a computer class exam.

Here we're training a logistic regression alogorithm using our own implementation of the following:
* Gradient Descent & Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Softmax logistic regression

The input dataset has been generated by a multinormal Gaussian distribution.
*No external packages other than Numpy are used here, we used pure python.*
